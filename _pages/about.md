Emai1: peterzhu \[at\] pku \[dot\] edu \[dot\] cn

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [CameraLab](https://camera.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). I received my B.Sc. degree from the school of electronic engineering and computer science in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn).

My research interest lies in computer vision and computational photography. I'm open to new ideas and cross-field collaboration. Feel free to contact me for further discussion.

During free time, I am also a passionate professional photographer, working with Visual China Group and Peking University. You may find my works published at the official account of PKU on such platforms as Weibo, Wechat, Instagram, etc.

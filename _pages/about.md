Emai1: peterzhu \[at\] pku \[dot\] edu \[dot\] cn

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at National Key Lab of General AI, School of Intelligence Science and Technology, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). Currently I'm working in [CameraLab](https://camera.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Boxin Shi](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Chao Xu](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1084/1267.htm). I received my B.Sc. degree from [school of electronic engineering and computer science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/Home/HOME.htm) in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn).

My research interest lies in computer vision and computational photography. I'm open to new ideas and cross-field collaboration. Feel free to contact me for further discussion.

During free time, I am also a passionate professional photographer, working with Visual China Group and Peking University. You may find my works published at the official account of PKU on such platforms as Weibo, Wechat, Instagram, etc.

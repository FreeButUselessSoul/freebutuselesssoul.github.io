Emai1: peterzhu \[at\] pku \[dot\] edu \[dot\] cn

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in computer science at the school of electronic engineering and computer science in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). Currently I'm a research assistant at the [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. [Boxin Shi](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in computer vision, computational photography, and neural rendering. I'm open to new ideas and cross-field collaboration. Feel free to contact me for discussion.

I am also a passionate semi-professional photographer. You may find my works at the official account of PKU on such platforms as Weibo and Wechat.
